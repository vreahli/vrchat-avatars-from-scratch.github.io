### Assumptions
- Basic to Intermediate modeling abilities
- No zbrush or substance painter required, but since I use them, I’ll cover them here
### Modeling and Topology
- Default T pose
- 30 and 70k polys are plenty
- Scaling
- Going back and forth between Zbrush and Blender
- Before continuing, now that modifying your topology after this point will make you re-texture and re-rig your model
- Testing for watertightness
- - Select by trait - ctrl + 
- Redoing it - pose mode, select all, select object, weight paint mode, automatic weight paints
### Previewing your avatar
- Unity import
- Getting the right version
- Test bones
- Testing your bones
- Setting up your camera
- Testing locally
- Errors when importing
- Importing from Blender
- Importing from FBX
- “Force T Pose”
### Moving to the next step:
- Apply your modifiers
Texturing
- Making UVs
- UVs with substance painter
- Editing textures in blender
- - Filling uv islands
- - Previewing your texture
- Editing textures externally
- Exporting textures
- Substance painter
- FBX gotchas
- Shader gotchas
### Rigging
- Default rigs
- Default bones
- Hips and alignment
- Figure out - weird standing
- Extra bones for dynamic bones
- Rigging and vertex groups
- Eye rig
- Clearing vertex groups
- Working with vertex Groups
- - In the 'n' menu - select a vertex, deselect it, then bring it back
- - Mirror modifier
- - Bug in vertex weights - have to turn it off then back on again
### Shape Keys
- Shape keys
- Visimes
- Additional rigging resources
- Blend shapes with zbrush
### Unity: 
- Bones
- Testing your muscles
- Multiple objects will have multiple materials
- Visimes
- Eyes
- Dynamic Bones
- Materials
### Issues in isolation
- Flexible bones and small areas (read: floppy ears.)
